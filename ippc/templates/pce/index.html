The PCE is aligned with the Phytosanitary Capacity Building Strategy of the IPPC.             Other benefits of the tool include:<br />            1.  Identification of gaps in the phytosanitary system which need to be addressed. <br />            2.  Conducting a stakeholders analysis and keeping track of stakeholders that are relevant in the phytosanitary system of the country<br />            3.  Conducting a problem analysis to identify the root cause of the gaps identified<br />            4.  Conducting and documenting strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats facing the NPPO in managing an effective phytosanitary system. <br />            5.  Assist in the development of a strategy to address key weakness identified.  The PCE includes a logical framework tool that can be used to generate a strategic framework for enhancing the phytosanitary system in the country. <br />            The PCE is useful as a tool for use by contracting parties to gauge progress of development of the phytosanitary system over time or as a tool to be used by facilitators of donors and technical assistance providers to build or strengthen phytosanitary capacity in countries as needed. <br />            The PCE is meant to be implemented at the pace defined by a country.  There is no urgency to complete the PCE when it is used for the purpose of self assessment.  A deadline may be needed in the case where a facilitator is engaged or the country requires it in order to develop a strategy or proposals for projects for funding either through the national budget or through other funding sources. <br />            The PCE is modular and the user can select the modules they want to apply or repeat.  There is no requirement for a full PCE to be applied every time it is launched. <br />            The PCE can be versioned - new sessions can be created.  The selected modules, whether all or a few, must be completed before a new session is made. <br />            Countries may apply it more frequently or less frequently as the case necessitates.  The IPPC recommends that the PCE be applied at a minimum interval of 3 years. <br />" %}            </p>

This person may be given access to the PCE through one of the following ways:<br />                1.  Person contracted directly by the IPPC/FAO to implement the PCE in IPPC or FAO projects. <br />                2.  Person, e. g.  consultant or other, where such person will facilitate the implementation of the PCE, given access by the IPPC only after the IPPC Contact Point authorizes such access to the country PCE data. <br />                On the first run of the PCE or at the beginning of every new session the user is presented with a three stage setup process. <br />                Stage 1 - Identify the persons that will manage the PCE process in the country. <br />                Stage 2 - Selected the modules that are of interest to the country. <br />                Stage 3 - Assign a coordinator to conduct the modules in a stakeholder setting (e. g.  meeting or workshop)<br />                Modules are clumped into 8 groupings.  The PCE manager is expected to assign a person who will coordinate the completion of each set of modules assigned to him/her.  Ideally the PCE manager will assign a person with competence over the subject matter of the modules.  It is therefore envisioned that 8 persons will coordinate the PCE country-wide.  In human resource constrained countries the PCE may be managed and coordinated in its entirety by 1 person or a few persons.  This is fine.   <br />" %}

These modules are categorised into 3 classes:<br />                System level - The modules pertaining to this class are general in nature and review processes and relevant issues of the phytosanitary system as a whole and do not place too much emphasis on institutions and the NPPO. <br />                Organizational - The modules in this class focus specifically on the role and functions of the NPPO.  The NPPO is the entity identified by the Government to discharge the functions ascribed to it by the IPPC. <br />                Core Activities - The modules in this class are technical in nature and are designed to assess management, human and infrastructure resources, and the relevant issues relating to ISPM implementation. <br />                To begin entering the data into the PCE tool each coordinator is required to complete a stakeholders table for each module.  Ideally the stakeholders should be a mix of private and public sector persons. <br />                Each session/meeting/workshop should be chaired by the coordinator assigned to complete the specific modules and stakeholders are invited to discuss the answers to each question.  The coordinator has sole editing rights to the PCE tool and can enter and delete the information during each session. <br />                There can only be 1 set of answers in the PCE per session.  It is therefore important that the coordinator receives consensus to each response from the stakeholders present at the time of completion of the PCE." %} <br />                .  <a href="/ippc/pce/help/modules/">{% trans "More about PCE Modules ?" %} </a></p>        </div>

Problem analysis - The users are asked to review the weakness or gaps identified and then to critically review them once more and refine them. <br />                2.  SWOT analysis - Once the weaknesses are agreed upon from the problem analysis, the users are asked to identify the strengths of the NPPO and threats and opportunities in relation to the weaknesses identified. <br />                3.  Logical Framework - When the SWOT table is complete.  The users are then provided with an tool to develop a logical framework using the SWOT and the problem analysis as a basis. <br />                Typically if the full PCE is applied there will be 12 logical frameworks produced each specific to the topic of the 12 modules.  The module on country data is an information only module and does not provide for a logical framework process to be applied. <br />                The PCE manager can then combine or consolidate the logical frameworks completed into a national phytosanitary development strategy and use it as a basis to prepare projects for funding from any relevant source, national or international." %} <br />  <a href="/ippc/pce/help/planning/">{% trans "More about PCE Planning ?" %}</a></p>        </div>        <h3><a href="javascript:hideshow(document.getElementById('adiv4'))">{% trans "IV - Results"%}</a></h3>
